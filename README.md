In this project we will make an attempt at building a Ray Tracing algorithm from scratch. 

### Util
I have made some util classes that will be used in the rest of the code. Here is a short overview of the different classes and there uses.

| Class  | What the class does.                                                                            |
| -------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Matrix | This class contains basic matrix operations such as multiplication, substration, summation, ... |
| Vector | This class will be the representation of a vector  |
